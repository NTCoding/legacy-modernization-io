An inner-sourced client migration is when the team rolling out a new version of their service (which has a new API) submits a pull request in the codebase of clients of the service to migrate them to the new version. It's intended to be a win-win: the service-provider team doesn't have to wait for clients to migrate, and clients have to spend less of their time on migrating.
