# Inner-Sourced Migration Pattern

The Inner-Sourced Migration pattern applies open-source principles within an organization to modernize legacy systems through collaborative effort and shared ownership.

## How It Works

1. Open up the legacy codebase for contributions across the organization
2. Create clear guidelines for contributions and code reviews
3. Establish a knowledge sharing framework for legacy system expertise
4. Distribute migration tasks across multiple teams
5. Use inner-source platforms and tools to track progress and contributions

## Benefits

- **Knowledge Distribution**: Spreads expertise about the legacy system across the organization
- **Reduced Bottlenecks**: Prevents modernization efforts from stalling due to limited resources in a single team
- **Increased Engagement**: Teams feel ownership over the parts they help modernize
- **Better Quality**: More eyes on the code leads to higher quality outcomes
- **Skills Development**: Developers gain experience in both legacy and modern technologies

## Drawbacks

- **Coordination Overhead**: Requires significant coordination effort across teams
- **Inconsistent Approaches**: Different teams might implement solutions in different ways
- **Governance Challenges**: Balancing central guidance with distributed decision-making
- **Potential for Distraction**: Teams may become distracted from their primary responsibilities

## When to Use

The Inner-Sourced Migration Pattern is ideal when:
- The legacy system knowledge is concentrated in a small number of people
- Multiple teams depend on the legacy system
- The organization has a collaborative culture
- The modernization effort is too large for a single team to handle
- You want to build organization-wide ownership of the modernized system
