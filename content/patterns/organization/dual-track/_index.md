Dual Track is an organizational pattern where a single team splits their work across two (or more) tracks. For example, half of the team's capacity is spent on new features and maintenance while the other half of the team's capacity is dedicated to modernization.

This pattern is worth considering when the forces of building new features take priority over modernization, so modernization moves slowly or not at all. Dual tracks addresses this problem by having a fixed allocation for modernization work.
