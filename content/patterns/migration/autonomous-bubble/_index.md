The Autonomous Bubble is an alternative to the [Bubble](/patterns/migration/bubble/_index.md) that has it's own datastore. As a result, it is able to service requests without translating and delegating to the legacy. For this to work, an asynchronous synchronization mechanism between the bubble and legacy datastores is used.
