Change Data Capture (CDC) is a technique for identifying and capturing changes made to data in a database so that these changes can be processed, replicated, or synchronized elsewhere. CDC enables real-time data integration, event-driven architectures, and efficient data pipelines by tracking inserts, updates, and deletes as they happen, rather than relying on periodic full data loads.
