This section lists common patterns encountered when modernizing legacy systems. These patterns touch on different aspects of modernization from technical integrations to organization to DDD and domain modelling.

## Pattern Categories

- [Migration](/patterns/migration/)
- [Data Synchronisation](/patterns/data-synchronisation/)
- [Organization](/patterns/organization/)

Remember that there are common patterns but every modernization journey is unique and patterns can appear and be applied differently in different contexts.
